Taken from the Serial Killer Information Center (http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Serial%20Killer%20Information%20Center/Project%20Description.htm).

The serial killer information center was created to provide students, researchers, and the media with accurate data on serial killers. The project began in 1992 and data are added and revised on a continual basis. To date, the Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database contains data on 4,068 serial killers.

The database was created using information collected by Radford University students from a variety of sources including prison records, court transcripts, media sources, true crime books, and the Internet. Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of the information.

For this project, serial killers were defined as individuals who killed at least two people, representing two or more individual events, with a cooling off period between the events. The motivation (e.g., economic, power, thrill) was not considered in the definition but will be addressed by placing serial killers into subtypes.
