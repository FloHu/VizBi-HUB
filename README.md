# VizBi-HUB
Collection of datasets for HUB 22 – Visual Perspectives in Science

## UFO sitings
UFO sightings are from http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html

## Orange trees
The Orange data frame has 35 rows and 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees.

## Cat health
Cat data: The heart and body weights of samples of male and female cats used for _digitalis_ experiments.  The cats were all adult, over 2 kg body weight. (from R's MASS package)

## Animal movements

Taken from [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org), which provides (as I write) data associated with around 50 published articles using location data of a range of different aniamls.

### Kestrels

I've included one dataset focused on kestrels, which I accessed from [this page in the Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/browse?value=Herna%CC%81ndez-Pliego%2C+Jesu%CC%81s&type=author) which should be cited so:

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodríguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Why do kestrels soar? PLOS ONE. 10(12): e0145402. [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0145402](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145402)

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodriguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Data from: Why do kestrels soar? Movebank Data Repository. doi:10.5441/001/1.sj8t3r11

It's in folder "kestrels"

### Zebras

To be cited as

to be found in folder "Zebras"

## Galaxies

In the GalaxyZoo folder, is a file containing information about the images (galaxyData.csv) in the images folder

Found via http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ which pointed me to http://www.sdss.org/dr12./ described in this article http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/219/1/12/meta;jsessionid=F71FE985792C4CE9913D141C0589FE4C.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org

I looked through images via the galaxyzoo website classifier link, and pulled out and saved info on images that are relatively different from each other i.e. I wanted to find a small data set which showed lots of different kinds of galaxy morphologies.
