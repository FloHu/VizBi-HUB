# VizBi-HUB
Collection of datasets for HUB 22 – Visual Perspectives in Science

### UFO sightings
UFO sightings are from [NUFORC](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html), an organisation investigating UFO sightings in the US.

### Orange trees
The Orange data frame has 35 rows and 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees.

### Animal locations

Taken from [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org), which provides (as I write) data associated with around 50 published articles using location data of a range of different animals.

### Kestrels

I've included one dataset focused on [kestrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kestrel), which I accessed from [this page in the Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/browse?value=Herna%CC%81ndez-Pliego%2C+Jesu%CC%81s&type=author) which should be cited so:

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodríguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Why do kestrels soar? PLOS ONE. 10(12): e0145402. [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0145402](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145402)

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodriguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Data from: Why do kestrels soar? Movebank Data Repository. doi:10.5441/001/1.sj8t3r11

It's in folder "kestrels"

### Zebras

to be found in folder "Zebras"

### Elasmobranches

This data, describing sitings of [elasmobranch fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasmobranchii
) i.e. sharks and rays is in the file Reef_Life_Survey_Global_reef_fish_dataset_Elasmobranch.csv . This was obtained from the [Reef Life Survey](http://reeflifesurvey.imas.utas.edu.au) website, which we came across when reading the [article describing this data](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20147) in the Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Data. This file is in the directory "Elasmobranches". It describes locations of sitings of such fish across the world.

### Galaxies

In the GalaxyZoo folder, is a file containing information about the images (galaxyData.csv) in the images folder

Found via http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ which pointed me to http://www.sdss.org/dr12./ described in this article http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/219/1/12/meta;jsessionid=F71FE985792C4CE9913D141C0589FE4C.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org

I looked through images via the galaxyzoo website classifier link, and pulled out and saved info on images that are relatively different from each other i.e. I wanted to find a small data set which showed lots of different kinds of galaxy morphologies.

### London data from LondonMapper

This comes from http://www.londonmapper.org.uk, and is in the LondonBoroughs folder.

The map showing where the boroughs are (LondonmapperBasemap.jpg) I got from http://www.londonmapper.org.uk/maps/reference-map/#basemap and is with a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 – Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/

### London Underground/Tube Data

[http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/#metric=total&year=2014&layers=TTTTT&zoom=12&lon=-0.1059&lat=51.5283](London Tube Data Map), an interactive online map that lets you query Tube usage data and display it in many different ways. Note - the London Underground train lines are collectively referred to often as "The Tube"

[Transport for London (TfL)](https://tfl.gov.uk/) provides data on a range of different aspects of public transport usage in London. [This page](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds?intcmp=3671) has links to counts of customer entry and exit at all the stations, separated into weekdays, Saturday, and Sunday. The file in the LondonUnderground folder is for a weekday from 2010 counts-entries-10-weekday-sample.csv

[Elsewhere on the TfL site](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/underground-services-performance) is a link to Entry and exit figures by year in Excel format: multi-year-station-entry-and-exit-figures.xls found at [this link](https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/multi-year-station-entry-and-exit-figures.xls)

The Tube Map is in the LondonUnderground folder in the file large-print-tube-map.pdf taken from [this link](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/large-print-tube-map.pdf) found on [this page](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube).

### Lemur life history

Data DataRecord_1b_DLC_LH_Table_Analysis_06Jun14-1.csv was found after reading [this article](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201419#t2) in Scientific Data i.e. Zehr SM, Roach RG, Haring D, Taylor J, Cameron FH, Yoder AD (2014) Life history profiles for 27 strepsirrhine primate taxa generated using captive data from the Duke Lemur Center. Scientific Data 1: 140019. http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.19

The files we include are taken from this record in the [DRYAD database](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974) and are storred together with a readme file describing its content. Also included is a PDF of the Scientific Data article describing the content sdata201419.pdf

This content is found in the direcory "Lemurs"

### World Bank Data
The World Bank provides a [wealth of economic data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator). In the directory "WorldBankData" you find world-wide data on womens's fertility, high technology exports, intellectual property and income shares held by the lower and upper 20% of the population. 

### Cars
The data was extracted from the 1974 _Motor Trend_ US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).

### Serial Killers
This rather gruesome dataset is taken from the [Serial Killer Information Center](http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Serial%20Killer%20Information%20Center/Project%20Description.htm) of Radford University.

### Extramarital Affairs
Taken from R's Ecdat package. People are always interested in such things.

### 3D Macromolecular Structure

The file "2db3.pdb.gz" in the directory 3DMacromolecularStructure is a single protein, with two domains, including also RNA and an ATP analog. You could download the file from the PDB [here](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2db3).

You could download and install a 3D macromolecular structure viewer such as [Chimera](http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/index.html) to visualise the PDB file. Here is the [Chimera download page](http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html)

Taking a question from a [training session](http://www.russelllab.org/wiki/index.php/Exercise:_DDX3X) taught by the [Russell Lab](http://www.russelllab.org/), including Matt Betts, who's at the HUB this evening in case you have any questions about this.

"A high-throughput sequencing analysis of human childhood brain cancer tumours revealed several mutations in DDX3X:

- D329V (the aspartate at position 329 is mutated to valine)
- R326C
- G530A
- R534S
- R326C
- R475C
- R376S
- S412F
- H527Y
- I214S
- F357S 

What does DDX3X do and how? How might these mutations affect its function (if at all) ?"

The structure in file 2db3.pdb.gz is of the Drosophila protein that is most similar to the human DDX3X protein.

You could try choosing several visualisations of the structure in Chimera that illustrate the role you think these mutations might have in the function of the protein.

An article describing the role of DDX3X in medulloblastomas is [described here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22832583) and is in the same directory in the file nihms466054.pdf in case that's of interest.
