# VizBi-HUB
Collection of datasets for HUB 22 – Visual Perspectives in Science

## UFO sitings
UFO sightings are from http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html

## Orange trees
The Orange data frame has 35 rows and 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees.

## Cat health
Cat data: The heart and body weights of samples of male and female cats used for _digitalis_ experiments.  The cats were all adult, over 2 kg body weight. (from R's MASS package)

## Animal locations

Taken from [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org), which provides (as I write) data associated with around 50 published articles using location data of a range of different aniamls.

### Kestrels

I've included one dataset focused on kestrels, which I accessed from [this page in the Movebank Data Repository](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/browse?value=Herna%CC%81ndez-Pliego%2C+Jesu%CC%81s&type=author) which should be cited so:

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodríguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Why do kestrels soar? PLOS ONE. 10(12): e0145402. [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0145402](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145402)

Hernández-Pliego J, Rodriguez C, Bustamante J (2015) Data from: Why do kestrels soar? Movebank Data Repository. doi:10.5441/001/1.sj8t3r11

It's in folder "kestrels"

### Zebras

To be cited as 

Bartlam-Brooks HLA, Beck PSA, Bohrer G, Harris S (2013) In search of greener pastures—using satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration. Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences v 188, p 1–11. doi:10.1002/jgrg.20096

to be found in folder "Zebras"

### Elasmobranches

This data, describing sitings of [elasmobranch fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasmobranchii
) i.e. sharks and rays is in the file Reef_Life_Survey_Global_reef_fish_dataset_Elasmobranch.csv . This was obtained from the [Reef Life Survey](http://reeflifesurvey.imas.utas.edu.au) website, which we came across when reading the [article describing this data](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20147) in the Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Data. This file is in the directory "Elasmobranches". It describes locations of sitings of such fish across the world.

## Galaxies

In the GalaxyZoo folder, is a file containing information about the images (galaxyData.csv) in the images folder

Found via http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ which pointed me to http://www.sdss.org/dr12./ described in this article http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/219/1/12/meta;jsessionid=F71FE985792C4CE9913D141C0589FE4C.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org

I looked through images via the galaxyzoo website classifier link, and pulled out and saved info on images that are relatively different from each other i.e. I wanted to find a small data set which showed lots of different kinds of galaxy morphologies.

## London data from LondonMapper

This comes from http://www.londonmapper.org.uk, and is in the LondonBoroughs folder.

The map showing where the boroughs are (LondonmapperBasemap.jpg) I got from http://www.londonmapper.org.uk/maps/reference-map/#basemap and is with a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 – Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/

Data tables provided in Excel and tab separated format are:

Carbon emissions per borough http://www.londonmapper.org.uk/maps/environment-and-travel/b-2011-carbonemissions/

Numbers of stag beetles sighted per borough http://www.londonmapper.org.uk/maps/environment-and-travel/b-2014-glnpstagbeetle/

## London Underground/Tube Data

[http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/#metric=total&year=2014&layers=TTTTT&zoom=12&lon=-0.1059&lat=51.5283](London Tube Data Map), an interactive online map that lets you query Tube usage data and display it in many different ways. Note - the London Underground train lines are collectively referred to often as "The Tube"

[Transport for London (TfL)](https://tfl.gov.uk/) provides data on a range of different aspects of public transport usage in London. [This page](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds?intcmp=3671) has links to counts of customer entry and exit at all the stations, separated into weekdays, Saturday, and Sunday. The file in the LondonUnderground folder is for a weekday from 2010 counts-entries-10-weekday-sample.csv

[Elsewhere on the TfL site](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/underground-services-performance) is a link to Entry and exit figures by year in Excel format: multi-year-station-entry-and-exit-figures.xls found at [this link](https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/multi-year-station-entry-and-exit-figures.xls)

The Tube Map is in the LondonUnderground folder in the file large-print-tube-map.pdf taken from [this link](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/large-print-tube-map.pdf) found on [this page](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube).
