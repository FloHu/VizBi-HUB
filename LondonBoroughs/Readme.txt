Description

Distribution of several datasets across the London, UK, boroughs (divisions/areas of the city). The map file shows the location of the different boroughs.

Data and files can be found at the LondonMapper website http://www.londonmapper.org.uk/

Column headings are hopefully self-explanatory.

Possible visualisations could look at comparing e.g. variation of carbon emissions compared to stag beetle sigtings.
